The Vim Way

# the . command
# x deletes the character under the cursor
# dd does that for the whole line
# >G increases the indentation from the current line until the end of the file

Line one
    Line two
        Line three
            Line four

# don't repeat yourself

# $ jumps the end of the line
# a;<ESC>.
# A;<ESC>j. A appends at the end of the current line: A = $a

var foo = 1;
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar

# C = c$ # deletes from cursor location
# s = cl # deletes one character
# S = ^C # deletes a line

# one step back, three forward
# f+ s ; 
# ; repeats the last search f did

var foo = "method(" + argument1 + "," + argument2 + ")";


#act, repeat, reverse
# @: repeats any Ex command
# & repeats the last :substitute (:s)
# reversing:
    # u undoes the last .
    # , jumps back for f
    # N is the reverse of / n

#recordings
# execute a range of changes with qx{changes}q
    # repeat @x
    # undo u
